			<h1>About Carrie Volpert</h1>
			<p class="tab">A little about me... <br /><br /> 
				I specialize in infrared and sub-mm to mm-wave astronomy, focusing on detector
				testing and development. Most of my work involves either TES technology or the
				still developing field of Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) superconducting 
				microresonator technology. My astronomy focuses are ISM astronomy, star formation,
				photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) and CI mapping. I formerly worked on the HAWC+
				instrument on SOFIA, and am currently working on a balloon-born mission called
				EXCLAIM running out of NASA Goddard. </p>
				
				p class="tab"> On a personal note, I'm from Philadelphia/London/Chicago/LA (in that order) but
				now live near DC. I love art and science outreach, pub trivia, cycling, and
				doing puzzles. Feel free to reach out about any science outreach opportunities.
