			<small> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in my studies at the University of Chicago, I came to realize that my interests lay in having a conversation with the physical world, not about it. 
				I first began pursuing experimental physics in my second year, whe I began to take interest in Professor Rich Kron's work revamping the department's 
				table spectroscope. In the intervening years I dabbled in spectroscopy, CCD imaging and operation, and amateur optical and radio telescope building
				through summer research opportunities, involvement in the Ryerson Astronomical Society (RAS), and independant projects. </p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my third year I began to work for Al Harper on HAWC+. For nearing three years now I have worked on NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared 
				Astronomy (SOFIA) as part of the instrument team for the High-resolution Widebandwidth Camera and Polarimeter (HAWC+). The instrument’s goal is to access 
				those regimes of the infrared spectrum inaccessible from the earth’s surface (i.e. the light absorbed or scattered by water vapor in the troposphere). 
				HAWC+ is a first-generation bolometer array instrument that provides an unprecedented combination of polarimetric sensitivity and angular resolution for 
				these far IR spectral bands. One of the primary goals of the instrument is to map polarized dust emission in molecular clouds. </p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last three years, under PI Charles Darren Dowell (JPL) and more directly Al Harper (U of C) and Giles Novak (Northwestern), I have contributed to
				the development of the instrument in a number of capacities. My first project within the instrument team involved constructing the periscope camera used for 
				instrumental alignment and writing the operation manual. Following this I began work with the instrument’s data pipeline and have been a part of the data 
				processing and analysis team ever since, working on phasing, diagnostics, instrument and data correction strategies, pipeline error analysis, and polarimetric 
				analysis, among other projects. I have been involved in diagnosing instrument cryogen and optical alignment problems. Most recently I have been working on 
				developing boresight corrections for the instrument for each spectral band.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to fly with HAWC+ on SOFIA last fall as part of the science team! We worked from 3pm, the beginning pre-flight prep, through the night flying and observing 
				until landing sometime between 3am and 6am the next day. The most recent flight series lasted several weeks, and we were able to collect our largest group of observations
				yet! In flight, I operated the instrument’s data pipeline in real-time to troubleshoot problems as they occurred in-air. It was exhausting, but tons of fun, and I got to
				hang out with a bunch of the cool folks from SOFIA!</p>
