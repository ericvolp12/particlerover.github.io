			<h1>So you're looking for a qualified researcher...</h1>
			<p class="tab"><br />What a coincidence! I will be on the job market soon.<br /> 
				
			<p> I intend to defend my thesis in Astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park in the beginning of 2024. 
        		</p>
        
			<p> Please reach out if you're looking for someone with experience in superconducting technology, spectroscopy, cryogenic systems, detectors, RF systems and radio telescopes, or local universe ISM astronomy.

        		I'd be happy to have a chat!
